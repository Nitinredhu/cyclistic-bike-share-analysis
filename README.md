### 3️⃣ Shift Marketing Focus to **Leisure Hours (11 AM – 3 PM)**
- **Why:** Members commute in rush hours (7–9 AM), while casuals ride during mid-day for leisure.  
- **Action:** Run *digital ads and social media campaigns* during mid-day hours to reach active leisure riders.

---

### 4️⃣ Promote Membership at **Tourist & Event Hotspots**
- **Why:** Most casual rides start near parks, beaches, and event venues — signaling leisure intent.  
- **Action:** Place *QR codes or pop-up kiosks* offering “instant membership upgrade” discounts at these popular locations.

---

### 5️⃣ Run an **A/B Test** for the 45-Minute Benefit
- **Why:** To validate how much the extended ride feature improves conversions.  
- **Action:** Run a *1-month A/B test* comparing the current 30-minute vs. 45-minute benefit and measure sign-up growth.
